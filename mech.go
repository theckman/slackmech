	// The mechanism for logging in to Slack is pretty interesting, and has some
	// checks that I believe were put in place to try and prevent misuse and
	// account hijacking. However, I question their effectiveness beyond
	// creating annoying barriers.
	//
	// The first thing to call out is that Slack does some User-Agent matching
	// in a few areas. It's important to use a Firefox or Chrome User-Agent
	// string, otherwise Slack will render some responses that are missing some
	// data we care about. Using the default Go User-Agent will not work as
	// expected. This was only slightly annoying to track down.
	//
	// To actually log in, the first thing that happens is you need to hit the
	// `/` resource for your Slack group (e.g., https://example.slack.com/). If
	// this responds with a 200, we're not logged in. A 302 (redirect) indicates
	// that we already have a valid cookie (logged in). If we're logged in we
	// can skip to getting the session details from the "/messages" resource.
	//
	// If we are not logged in (200 response), there are a few hidden input
	// fields in response body that should be posted with the sign in request.
	// You can find these in the sign in form. The one required value is that of
	// the "crumb" input field, which looks to be CSRF token that includes the
	// current UNIX epoch, as well as a SHA-512 hash that contains (at a
	// minimum) the current User-Agent string.
	//
	// The fact the crumb value's hash contains the User-Agent string is
	// important. If your User-Agent string changes between getting the "crumb"
	// value and making your log in POST request, Slack will silently refuse to
	// log you in without presenting an error message. This was annoying to
	// track down, so make sure you don't forget to use the same UA string. I
	// presume this is a "security feature" to help obscure the process of
	// trying to log in programmatically, as well as to generally prevent
	// misuse. It wasn't very effective.
	//
	// Once you have the "crumb" value, as well as the others, you can POST them
	// with the "email" and "password" values to the `/` resource for the Slack
	// group. Yes, this is the _same_ resource you got the login form from,
	// except now you're making a POST request instead of a GET request. And
	// yes, make sure you set the Content-Type to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
	// or the request will return a 200 with no error message. Props to Slack for
	// doing input validation.
	//
	// If you get a 200 from the POST request, you failed to authenticate/log
	// in. The response body may contain an error indicating the credentials are
	// wrong, or nothing if you sent a malformed request. A malformed request
	// could be that you didn't set the Content-Type, or your User-Agent has
	// changed since getting the "crumb" value (maybe others).
	//
	// If you got a 302 redirect, you've logged in! The first place it sends you
	// to is another endpoint
	// (https://slack.com/checkcookie?redir=YOURWORKSPACE) which validates that
	// your cookie is good, and redirects you to the root of your Slack
	// workgroup if it is indeed good. If the cookie is bad, it renders a page
	// (200 response) that tells you to enable support for cookies.
	//
	// If you've been redirected from the cookiecheck, you're sent to the root
	// of your Slack workspace which should then redirect you to the main
	// resource (/messages). Within the "/messages" HTML response body is the
	// API token we need for interacting with the API as a logged in user, as
	// well as other related pieces of information.
	//
	// From the HTML response body we care about the 'api_token', 'version_ts',
	// 'version_uid', and the 'boot_data.logout_url' inline JavaScript values.
	// We need to parse these values out of the HTML response body, and then we
	// have all of the information we need to have a full session. We also have
	// the URL needed to terminate our session, invalidate the api_token, and
	// delete the cookies.
	//
	// If you make use of the api_token, you can now interact with the Slack API
	// as if you were a logged in webapp user. This comes with certain
	// limitations lifted, depending on your role in the Slack workspace.
	//
